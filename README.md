## Power consumption
The application does switch off the GPS module and the MCU and LoRa transceiver go into sleep mode between measurement cycles to save power. I could measure a sleep current of 40uA of the whole system.

# Setting up LoRaWAN credentials
The LoRaWAN settings can be defined in three different ways. 
- Over BLE with [WisBlock Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.giesecke.wisblock_toolbox)
- Over USB with [AT Commands](./AT-Commands.md)
- Hardcoded in the sources (_**ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED**_)

## 1) Setup over BLE
Using the [WisBlock Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.giesecke.wisblock_toolbox) you can connect to the WisBlock over BLE and setup all LoRaWAN parameters like
- Region
- OTAA/ABP
- Confirmed/Unconfirmed message
- ...

More details can be found in the [WisBlock Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.giesecke.wisblock_toolbox)

The device is advertising over BLE only the first 30 seconds after power up and then again for 15 seconds after wakeup for measurements. The device is advertising as **`RAK-GNSS-xx`** where xx is the BLE MAC address of the device.

## 2) Setup over USB port
Using the AT command interface the WisBlock can be setup over the USB port.

A detailed manual for the AT commands are in [AT-Commands.md](./AT-Commands.md)

Here is an example for the typical AT commands required to get the device ready (EUI's and Keys are examples):
```log
// Setup AppEUI
AT+APPEUI=70b3d57ed00201e1
// Setup DevEUI
AT+DEVEUI=ac1f09fffe03efdc
// Setup AppKey
AT+APPKEY=2b84e0b09b68e5cb42176fe753dcee79
// Set automatic send frequency in seconds
AT+SENDFREQ=60
// Set data rate
AT+DR=3
// Set LoRaWAN region (here US915)
AT+BAND=8
// Reset node to save the new parameters
ATZ
// After reboot, start join request
AT+JOIN=1,0,8,10
```

## _REMARK_
The AT command format used here is _**NOT**_ compatible with the RAK5205/RAK7205 AT commands.

## 3) Hardcoded LoRaWAN settings
`void api_read_credentials(void);`    
`void api_set_credentials(void);`    
If LoRaWAN credentials need to be hardcoded (e.g. the region, the send repeat time, ...) this can be done in `setup_app()`.
First the saved credentials must be read from flash with `api_read_credentials();`, then credentials can be changed. After changing the credentials must be saved with `api_set_credentials()`.
As the WisBlock API checks if any changes need to be saved, the changed values will be only saved on the first boot after flashing the application.     
Example:    
```c++
// Read credentials from Flash
api_read_credentials();
// Make changes to the credentials
g_lorawan_settings.send_repeat_time = 240000;                   // Default is 2 minutes
g_lorawan_settings.subband_channels = 2;                        // Default is subband 1
g_lorawan_settings.app_port = 4;                                // Default is 2
g_lorawan_settings.confirmed_msg_enabled = LMH_CONFIRMED_MSG;   // Default is UNCONFIRMED
g_lorawan_settings.lora_region = LORAMAC_REGION_EU868;          // Default is AS923-3
// Save hard coded LoRaWAN settings
api_set_credentials();
```

_**REMARK 1**_    
Hard coded credentials must be set in `void setup_app(void)`!

_**REMARK 2**_    
Keep in mind that parameters that are changed from with this method can be changed over AT command or BLE _**BUT WILL BE RESET AFTER A REBOOT**_!

# Packet data format
Three different data packet formats are available:
1) Standard Cayenne LPP format as it is used by MyDevice. This format has a 4 digit precision for the GNSS location.     
2) Extended Cayenne LPP format. This format has a 6 digit precision for the GNSS location and gives a better precision of the location. A special data decoder is required for this data format.
Above two data formats include as well the battery level and (if available) the data from the BME680 environment sensor.    

The different LPP channels are assigned like this:   

| Data | Channel # | Channel ID | Length | Comment |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| GNSS data | 1 | 136 | 9 bytes | 4 digit precision |
| GNSS data | 1 | 137 | 11 bytes | 6 digit precision |
| Battery value | 2 | 2 | 2 bytes | in volt |
| Humidity | 3 | 104 | 1 bytes |  in %RH |
| Temperature | 4 | 103 | 2 bytes | in Â°C |
| Barmetric Pressure | 5 | 115 | 2 bytes | in hPa (mBar) |
| Gas resistance | 6 | 2 | 2 bytes | in kOhm, can be used to calculate air quality index |


3) Only location data formatted for the [Helium Mapper application](https://news.rakwireless.com/make-a-helium-mapper-with-the-wisblock/)    
This data packet contains only raw data without any data markers.    
**`4 byte latitude, 4 byte longitude, 2 byte altitude, 2 byte precision, 2 byte battery voltage`**

## _REMARK_
This application uses the RAK1904 acceleration sensor only for detection of movement to trigger the sending of a location packet, so the data packet does not include the accelerometer part.

# Change data format
To switch between the three data modes, a custom AT command is implemented.    
**`AT+GNSS`**

Description: Switch between data packet formats

This command allows the user to see the current data format or switch to another data format.

| Command                       | Input Parameter | Return Value                                               | Return Code              |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| AT+GNSS?                      | -               | `AT+GNSS: Get/Set the GNSS precision and format 0 = 4 digit, 1 = 6 digit, 2 = Helium Mapper` | `OK`                     |
| AT+GNSS=?                   | -               | *0, 1 or 2*                                                | `OK`                     |
| AT+GNSS=`<Input Parameter>` | *0, 1 or 2*     | -                                                          | `OK` or `AT_PARAM_ERROR` |

**Examples**:

```
AT+GNSS?

AT+GNSS: Get/Set the GNSS precision and format 0 = 4 digit, 1 = 6 digit, 2 = Helium Mapper    
OK

AT+GNSS=?

AT+GNSS:GPS precision: 2
OK

AT+GNSS=0

OK

AT+GNSS=3

+CME ERROR:5
```

# Compiled output
The compiled files are located in the [./Generated](./Generated) folder. Each successful compiled version is named as      
**`WisBlock_GNSS_Vx.y.z_YYYYMMddhhmmss`**    
x.y.z is the version number. The version number is setup in the [./platformio.ini](./platformio.ini) file.    
YYYYMMddhhmmss is the timestamp of the compilation.

The generated **`.zip`** file can be used as well to update the device over BLE using either [WisBlock Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.giesecke.wisblock_toolbox) or [Nordic nRF Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.nrftoolbox) or [nRF Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp)

# Debug options 
Debug output can be controlled by defines in the **`platformio.ini`**    
_**LIB_DEBUG**_ controls debug output of the SX126x-Arduino LoRaWAN library
 - 0 -> No debug outpuy
 - 1 -> Library debug output (not recommended, can have influence on timing)    

_**MY_DEBUG**_ controls debug output of the application itself
 - 0 -> No debug outpuy
 - 1 -> Application debug output

_**CFG_DEBUG**_ controls the debug output of the nRF52 BSP. It is recommended to keep it off

## Example for no debug output and maximum power savings:

```ini
[env:wiscore_rak4631]
platform = nordicnrf52
board = wiscore_rak4631
framework = arduino
build_flags = 
    ; -DCFG_DEBUG=2
	-DSW_VERSION_1=1 ; major version increase on API change / not backwards compatible
	-DSW_VERSION_2=0 ; minor version increase on API change / backward compatible
	-DSW_VERSION_3=0 ; patch version increase on bugfix, no affect on API
	-DLIB_DEBUG=0    ; 0 Disable LoRaWAN debug output
	-DMY_DEBUG=0     ; 0 Disable application debug output
	-DNO_BLE_LED=1   ; 1 Disable blue LED as BLE notificator
